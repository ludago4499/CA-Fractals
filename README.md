## CA-Fractals
Various collection of interesting physics and mathematical models regarding Cellular Automata, Fractals and more chaotic systems. 

A Project consisting mostly of Julia code. 

# 1 Excitable Media. 

Greenberg Hastings model with three states. Excited state, refractory state and excitable state.
Uses HTML and CSS to adjust initial excited and refractory states.

# 2 Mandelbrot 

A simple and short (unoptimized) Mandelbrot code. Can be varied by resolution, step count and the general formula for recursion. High resolution and step counts increase exponentially computing time. 

For n=2 (Normal Mandelbrot)
